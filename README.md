# LDS_Secret_Society_Members
A place to store all the data about known secret society members who have or do affiliate with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

We've documented all the secret society members from the University of Utah's Utonian digital archives, and are looking forward to expanding the scope of our project. The goal is to provide any interested researchers the data and tools they need to examine this interesting phenomenon.

Feel free to make suggestions and contribute to the project in any way you feel inspired to.
